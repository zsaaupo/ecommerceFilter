## Important Note: Ensure Proper Admin Logout

Before using the filter option, make sure to log out from the admin panel to prevent any potential errors. A logged-in admin session might interfere with the filtering process. If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have logged out of the admin account and try the filter option again.

This step will help in maintaining a smooth and error-free experience while using the filtering functionality.
